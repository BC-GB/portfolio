**Problem:** Managing personal finances requires tracking spending and generating analytics, yet manual data entry is tedious. Additionally, inventory management is essential to consolidate orders and prevent stock-outs.

**Approach:** Adopted a structured categorisation system (General Expenses, Recurring Expenses, Capital). Critically evaluated database design and user experience to ensure intuitive workflows. Integrated AI text parsing to eliminate manual data entry. Built analytics dashboard for spending insights, with future opportunities for AI-driven behavioural analysis.

**Strategic Impact:** Improved cost efficiency through better spending visibility; enhanced time efficiency by automating and streamlining data entry, analytics generation, and inventory forecasting.

**Tech:** TypeScript, React, Python, FastAPI, SQLite

**Problem:** Managing stock picks and portfolio requires visiting multiple sites and manually crunching numbers—a time-intensive process unsuitable for busy academic schedules.

**Approach:** Leveraged Python's speed and flexibility to automate data collection, cleansing, and export to Excel. Designed workflows to eliminate repetitive manual analysis.

**Strategic Impact:** Significant time efficiency gains through automation; enhanced structured decision-making capability through defined criteras.

**Tech:** Python

**Problem:** Traditional note-taking and to-do tools lack the ability to intuitively plan workload relative to exam dates, and involves tedious data entry (whether be it by inputting tasks or rescheduling).

**Approach:** Built a simple, intuitive tracker with manually editable YAML configuration. Uniquely includes exam dates to enable workload planning in relation to deadlines. YAML structure allows AI-generated study schedules to be pasted directly into the system.

**Strategic Impact:** Enhanced revision efficiency through deadline-aware planning; improved time management by leveraging AI for optimised scheduling.

**Tech:** JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS
