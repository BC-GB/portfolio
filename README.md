**Problem:** Managing personal finances requires tracking spending and generating analytics, yet manual data entry is tedious. Additionally, inventory management is essential to consolidate orders and prevent stock-outs.

**Approach:** Adopted a structured categorisation framework (General Expenses, Recurring Expenses, Capital). Critically evaluated database design and user experience to ensure intuitive workflows. Integrated AI text parsing to eliminate manual data entry. Built analytics dashboard for spending insights, with future opportunities for AI-driven behavioural analysis.

**Strategic Impact:** Improved cost efficiency through better spending visibility; enhanced time efficiency by automating data entry, analytics generation, inventory forecasting.

**Tech:** TypeScript, React, Python, FastAPI, SQLite

**Problem:** Managing stock picks and portfolio requires visiting multiple sites and manually crunching numbers—a time-intensive process unsuitable for busy schedules.

**Approach:** Leveraged Python's speed and flexibility to automate data collection, cleansing, and export to Excel. Designed structured workflows to eliminate repetitive manual analysis.

**Strategic Impact:** Significant time efficiency gains through automation; enhanced decision-making capability with consolidated, clean data.

**Tech:** Python

### [Exam Study Tracker](https://github.com/BC-GB/exam-study-tracker)

<img width="1920" alt="Study Dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/889662bb-244f-498a-a629-787c76009187">

**Problem:** Traditional note-taking and to-do tools lack the ability to intuitively plan workload relative to exam dates, and involves tedious data entry (whether be it by inputting tasks or rescheduling them), limiting efficient revision planning.

**Approach:** Built a simple, intuitive tracker with manually editable YAML configuration. Uniquely includes exam dates to enable workload planning in relation to deadlines. YAML structure allows AI-generated study schedules to be pasted directly into the system.

**Strategic Impact:** Enhanced revision efficiency through deadline-aware planning; improved time management by leveraging AI for optimised scheduling.

**Tech:** JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS
